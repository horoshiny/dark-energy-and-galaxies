This passion project is trying to find if dark energy influencces galaxies from formation to their spinning velocities.
Currently, it is known and seen that dark energy is responsible for the expansion of spacetime and largely doesn't affect galaxies. 
In simpler words, I'm trying to see if dark energy can have an effect in formation of galaxies.
The dataset is obtained from the SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves) database, a publicly available and widely used astronomical resource.
Size:
It contains several thousand observations across multiple galaxies, with rotation measurements recorded at different radial distances.

Key Features:
Kinematic Data: Observed rotational velocity and its measurement uncertainty.
Baryonic Contributions: Velocity components from gas, stellar disk, and bulge.
Photometric Data: Surface brightness of disk and bulge regions.
Structural Details: Radial distance and galaxy identifiers.
