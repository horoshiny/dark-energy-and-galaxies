This passion project is trying to find if dark energy influencces galaxies from formation to their spinning velocities.
Currently, it is known and see that dark energy is responsible for the expansion of spacetime and largely doesn't affect galaxies. 
In simpler words, I'm trying to see if dark energy can have an effect in formation of galaxies.
